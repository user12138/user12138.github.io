The transition from childhood to adult life is hard.

从童年到成年的过渡是艰难的。

Our parents give us attention all our adolescent years. But as soon as we cross an age limit and step into the outside world, a brick of reality hits our heads.

我们的父母给予我们整个青少年时期的关心。但是，一旦我们跨越年龄限制，进入外面的世界，现实的一块砖击中了我们的头。

It's written on the brick in big-bold letters, "NO ONE CARES."

砖上用粗体字写着：“没人在乎。“

No one cares who you are, what you know, and what you have created. People are busy in their own lives. They are lost in their own world.

没有人在乎你是谁，你知道什么，你创造了什么。人们都在自己的生活中忙碌。他们迷失在自己的世界里。

You've released the world's dopest music album? No one cares.

你发行了世界上最酷的音乐专辑？没人在乎

You've spent two years writing a novel? No one cares.

你花了两年时间写小说？没人在乎

You've made a fantastic app that solves a big problem? No one...

你做了一个很棒的应用程序，解决了一个大问题？没有人...

That's exactly where marketing comes in.

这正是市场营销的用武之地。

Marketing is the humble act of accepting that people out there are not your mother or father. They won't give you attention. It is your duty to market your product. It is your duty to make people care.

市场营销是一种谦卑的行为，接受外面的人不是你的父母。他们不会给你给予关注。推销你的产品是你的责任。你的责任是让人们关心你。
